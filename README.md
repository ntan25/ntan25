## About Me

I am a student at the [Universty of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/)
studying [Quantitative Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/undergrad/minor-computer-science/). I hope to be in an engineering role some time in the future, looking to improve the human condition at scale.
